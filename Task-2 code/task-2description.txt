A URL link shortener is a tool or service that converts long URLs into shorter, more manageable links.
The primary purpose of a link shortener is to create compact URLs that are easier to share, remember,
and type.

Here's how a typical URL link shortener works:

=>User Input: The user provides a long URL that they want to shorten. This can be any valid URL, such 
             as a webpage, blog post, or document link.

=>Shortening Algorithm: The link shortener applies an algorithm to generate a unique and shorter alias
              for the given long URL. This algorithm typically involves encoding the original URL and 
              generating a random or sequential identifier.

=> Storage: The short URL, along with its associated long URL, is stored in a database or some form of
          data storage. This allows the link shortener to map the short URL back to the original long 
          URL.

=> Redirect: When a user clicks on the shortened link, the link shortener server receives the request 
          for the short URL. It looks up the associated long URL in its storage based on the provided 
          short URL and performs a redirect to the original long URL.
